= vertx-dependent-deploy

This project demonstrates synchronization of starting processes
(sending messages from one verticle to another verticle) between
different verticles.

Suggested approach allows preventing the sending a message to a verticle
before the verticle will finish deployment.

The "bad" package is example of non-synchronized processes.

The "good" package is example of synchronized processes.
